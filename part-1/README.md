# Olympic Judge Average

This program involved writing a function that computes the average mean of all elements of a vector except the minimum and the maximum. 

## What to Do

1. With your partner, edit the `judge.cc` source file using VS Code. Add the required header. Replace all the TODO comments with working code.
1. Your program must use the `JudgeAverage` function. Do not change the prototype of this function (name, return type, argument types).
1. Compile your program with the `$ make` shell command. Use the **debug compile error** procedure to debug any compile errors.
1. Run your program with the `$ ./judge` shell command.
1. Test that your program passes all of the test cases in the test suite above. If your program suffers a runtime error, use the **debug runtime error** procedure to debug the error. If your program does not produce the expected output, use the **debug logic error** procedure to debug the error.
1. Test your program against automated test with the `$ make test` command. Debug any runtime errors or logic errors using the same procedures.
1. Check your header with the `$ make header` shell command. Correct any errors.
1. Check for format errors with the `$ make format` shell command. Correct any errors.
1. Check for lint errors with the `$ make lint` shell command. Correct any errors.
1. After your program passes all of these tests and checks, push your code to GitHub. Use the usual trio of commands: `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push`.

## Olympic Judge Average

In some Olympics events, such as figure skating, scores are determined by judges.
To keep the judging fair, there are several judges. Each judge assigns a score,
and all of the scores are averaged together by an algorithm that is intended to
eliminate impartial scores. This exercise involves writing a function that computes
this kind of average.

[The averaging algorithm](https://www.usfigureskating.org/about/scoring-system) is:
1. at least three judges choose a numerical score (for example, figure skating is on a scale of 0.0 to 6.0);
1. the least (minimum) score is eliminated
1. the greatest (maximum) score is eliminated
1. the remaining scores are averaged together, using the *mean average:*

$$ \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n a_i .$$

In words, the mean average is the total of the remaining scores, divided by the count of those scores.

Eliminating the least and greatest scores is intended to achieve fairness by preventing a biased judge
from affecting the final score. If a judge has it out for a particular contestant for some reason, such as bigotry,
and assigns an unfairly low score, it will probably be the low score that gets eliminated. Likewise,
if a judge is trying to elevate someone for some reason, such as a bribe, and assigns an unfairly
high score, it will be the maximum that gets eliminated.

For example:
1. five judges assign scores: 5.8, 5.6, 5.7, 5.9, 5.8
1. eliminate the least score of 5.6: 5.8, ~~5.6,~~ 5.7, 5.9, 5.8
1. eliminate the greatest score of 5.9: 5.8, ~~5.6,~~ 5.7, ~~5.9,~~ 5.8
1. the remaining scores are averaged together: $(5.8 + 5.7 + 5.8) \div 3 = (17.3) \div 3 \approx 5.767$

Your program can calculate the average mean of all the elements except the minimum and the maximum by computing the sum of all the elements, compute the maximum, compute the minimum, eliminate the maximum and the minimum from the sum, then compute the average mean by dividing the sum to the number of elements minus 2. These steps are part of a single function `JudgeAverage`.

The function has a single parameter of type `const &`, which is what we call [pass by const reference](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/pass-by-const-lvalue-reference/). Do not change the prototype of this function (name, return type, argument types).

Your program must:
1. Take the judge scores as command line arguments.
1. Validate that there are at least three scores. If too few arguments are given, print an error message and return a non-zero exit code.
1. Converts each score from a string into a floating point.
1. Compute the Olympic average as described above using floating point arithmetic (`double` or `float` types) so that fractional scores are handled accurately.
1. Print an output message in the form
   ```
   average is *Olympic average*
   ```
1. Return exit code zero.

## Functions

### `JudgeAverage`

```C++
// Calculate and return the Olympics average of scores.
// The return value is the mean of all elements of scores, except for the
// minimum and maximum elements.
double JudgeAverage(const std::vector<double>& scores)
```

### `main`

As usual, you need to complete the program's `main` function.

## Example Input and Output

```
$ ./judge
error: you must give at least three scores
```

```
$ ./judge 1 2
error: you must give at least three scores
```

```
$ ./judge 1 2 3
average is 2
```
(↑ the 1 and 3 are eliminated)

```
$ ./judge 5.1 8.7 9.0 2.6 1.9
average is 5.46667
```
(↑ the 1.9 and 9.0 are eliminated)


```
$ ./judge 4 2 9 9 3
average is 5.33333
```
(↑ the 2, and one of the 9s, are elminiated)

## Test Cases

As usual, test your program against the test suite below.

| Test Case | Input                              | Expected Output                                                       |
|-----------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1         | (no arguments")            | `error: you must give at least three scores`        |
| 2         | 1 2             | `error: you must give at least three scores`        |
| 3         | 1 2 3      | `average is 2` |
| 4         | 5.1 8.7 9.0 2.6 1.9          | `average is 5.46667`  |
| 5         | 4 2 9 9 3             | `average is 5.33333`     |
